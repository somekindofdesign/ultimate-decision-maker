<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The first release of the Ultimate Decision Maker website includes several vital features which are detailed below. Future releases should include additional features as outlined in the 'Features Left to Implement' section.</p>
<br>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>
<strong>The navigation bar</strong>
<p>Featured on all pages, this fully responsive navigation includes links to the landing page, the game play, a how to page and an about page. It is exactly replicated across the site to ensure consistency for the user.</p>

<p>The navigation allows users to browse the site from any page without having to use the back button on their device.</p>

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allow users to choose 'best out of 3' games</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Throughout the development of this site, testing was carried out on different devices using the developer tools on multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.</p>

<p>This was repeated towards the end of the project using the free testing tool on <a href="https://live.browserstack.com/dashboard">BrowserStack.com</a>, while extending the reach of testing to other Windows OS, the browser Safari and multiple MacOS. It is worth noting that as this is a free tool, the accuracy of the tests may be limited.</p>

<p>For all testing, each page was reviewed across the following criteria;
<ul>
    <li>Layout and positioning (ie is everything where it's expected to be on all devices)</li>
    <li>Functions (ie buttons, links, inputs, etc)</li>
    <li>Features (ie image rendering, form fill and submission, etc)</li>
    <li>Consistency, convention and expectation (ie does it allow affordance to the user)</li>
</ul>
</p>
