# Welcome to The Ultimate Decision Maker
<p>The Ultimate Decision Maker is a tongue-in-cheek online game, here to help you make the difficult decisions in your life.</p>
<p>Based on the popular online game 'Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock', which is in turn based on the popular real life game 'Rock Paper Scissors', the game can be used to make non-binding decisions without the mental effort required of deciding or to settle objective disagreements between friends and family.</p>
<p>It is a demonstration of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills as required by Portfolio 2 Assessment as part of the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.</p>

<h2>User Experience</h2>
<hr>
<p>Prior to development, the Ultimate Decision Maker was wireframed using design software, <a href="https://somekindofdesign/??">Figma</a>. This was to ensure that the design and experience of the site was fully explored and that it enhanced user experience. Although changes were made during development, it provided vital structure and guidance to the project.</p>

<br>

<strong>User Goals</strong>
<ul>
<li>Come to a conslusion with little input</li>
<li>Make an objective decision between two options</li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>User Stories</strong>
<p>It is assumed that all users have access to a device capable of connecting to the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm hungry and tired and want to order food for delivery to my house but can't decide if I want to order pizza or sushi</li>
<li>We want to watch a film together but I want to watch a horror and my husband wants to watch a comedy</li>
<li>While socialisng together, my housemate voices his opinion that Ariana Grande has the best songs but I want to demonstrate that it is, in fact, Dua Lipa that has the best songs</li>
<li>I'm feeling a bit lonely today but I work 40 hours a week and commute 2 hours a day so I can't decide if I should adopt a Siberian Husky puppy or not</li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>Brand Design</strong>
<p>The site mimics the static, blocky style of early arcade games such as Pacman and Space Invaders. Classic games have seen a revival in popular culture over the last number of years and the Ultimate Decision Maker aims to be part of that nostalgia.
<ul>
<li>Colour: The colour palette uses a dark background and bright, solid colours to highlight different functions and features while relying on white for important detailed information.</li>
<li>Typography: By using a pixel font for large, headline type and a clean sans-serif for smaller informative type, the typography upholds the arcade theme while maintaining legibilty.</li>
<li>Imagery: Relying on using repeated icons throughout the site and the game itself is a style choice that mimics the limitations of classic arcade games. In fact, photography could look out of place on the site.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>Accessibility</strong>
<p>Colour schemes, typography, button sizes and icon sizes have been designed to align with WCAG 2.0 accessbility guidelines (link??) up to AAA standard.</p>
<br>

<strong>Responsivity</strong>
<p>The site was designed and built mobile first (from 320px) with each element considered for their behaviour on all devices from initial sketching. Em, rem and percentage units and media queries are used were appropriate ensuring an optimised experience for all. Similarly, maximum width has been applied to maintain structure for extra large screens.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<hr>
<p>The first release of the Ultimate Decision Maker website includes several vital features which are detailed below. Future releases should include additional features as outlined in the 'Features Left to Implement' section.</p>
<br>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>
<strong>Landing</strong>
<p>The goal of the landing page is to entice and interest the user in playing the game while simultaneously introducing them to the brand. It includes several key markers including the logo in the header, the stylised type and the icons demonstrating the choices in the game.</p>

<p><img width="640px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_desktop.PNG" alt="??"></p>
<br>

<strong>Navigation</strong>
<p>Featured on all pages, this fully responsive navigation includes links to the landing page, the game, a how-to page and an about page. It is exactly replicated across the site to ensure consistency for the user.</p>

<p>The navigation allows users to browse the site from any page without having to use the back button on their device.</p>

<p><img width="640px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_desktop.PNG" alt="??"></p>
<p><img width="375px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_mobile.PNG" alt="??"></p>
<br>

<strong>Decision Maker Game</strong>
<p>The core of the site, this is the game function. Users are provided with instruction and visual cues direct them through the game as they play. They can choose their hand repeatedly and continue the game indefinitley if they wish or reset the game and start over.</p>

<br>

<strong>How-To</strong>
<p>For users that are unfamiliar with Rock Paper Scissors Spock or indeed Rock Paper Scissors, this page allows them to preview the game rules and plan their strategy to beat this game of chance. It also includes a brief history of the game and how it has developed over the years.</p>

<p><img width="480px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_desktop.png" alt="??"></p>
<br>

<strong>About</strong>
<p>This page of the site is for users who want to know more about who made the game. It also includes a ghost cursor as an element of fun for the user and additional support for the retro theme. The code for this was provided by <a href="https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects">Tholman</a> - see credits for further information.</p>

<p><img width="480px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_desktop.png" alt="??"></p>
<br>

<strong>Submit Ideas Form</strong>
<p>Here users have the opportunity to contact the game developer with their own idea for a similar game.</p>

<p><img width="480px" height=auto src="assets/images/readme/??_desktop.png" alt="??"></p>
<br>

<strong>Footer</strong>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<hr>
<p>Throughout the development of this site, testing was carried out on different devices using the developer tools on multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. For all testing, each page was reviewed across the following criteria;
<ul>
    <li>Layout and positioning (ie is everything where it's expected to be on all devices)</li>
    <li>Functions (ie buttons, links, inputs, etc)</li>
    <li>Features (ie image rendering, form fill and submission, etc)</li>
    <li>Consistency, convention and expectation (ie does it allow affordance to the user)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<p>This was repeated towards the end of the project using the free testing tool on <a href="https://live.browserstack.com/dashboard">BrowserStack.com</a>, while extending the reach of testing to other Windows OS, the browser Safari and multiple MacOS. It is worth noting that as this is a free tool, the accuracy of the tests may be limited.</p>

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are several bugs that need to be addressed in the next iteration of this project. None are currently blocking game-play or make the site difficult to use but all will improve the overall user experience.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Form success message:</strong> The form successfully posts the data after the user submits but they are redirected to the Code Institute 'Form Dump'. A more user friendly version should be implemented that is branded and contains instruction and a call to action. An on-page submit message has been coded but the form is not confirmed to post when using this method so it is inactive currently.</li>
    <li><strong>Space between content:</strong> Empty divs before function is executed are creating unnecessary space between content requiring additional scrolling on mobile.</li>
    <li><strong>Game reset position:</strong> Currently when the user resets the game, the page refreshes and the user is brought back to the top and away from the game. A different solution is required to reset the scores while preserving the scroll position.</li>
    <li><strong>Jshint warnings:</strong> Although not an error, it should be noted that the following warning is given for most .js pages in this project: "'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)". This should be monitored.</li>
</ul>
